# FitNest - Fitness At Its Best
## About
Due to its drastic increase during the past decade, obesity is becoming an epidemic
phenomenon in most developed countries. 

The fact that more than thirty-three percent of 
adults and sixteen percent of children are obese has proven to be one of the
biggest public health challenges to the general population and social welfare.
Unfortunately, obesity has still not been controlled effectively.

Also, due to COVID-19, people have been mostly eating at their homes only, leading
to the illusion that theyâ€™re eating healthy. The amount of preservatives they have
been intaking missing from fast food is immense. Mindless eating while working from
home can be a disaster to one's health.

This is why we propose a Food Detector - FitNest for the AngelHacks 2.0. 

Based on a photo taken by the user, the app detects the food present and respectively
finds nutritional information for the given food. The user can then log this data into
a virtual diary which would help keep track of their calories consumed.


**Business Model**:
1. Swiggy Idea-Swiggy/Zomato could use this as they can show through our app(if integrated)
the nutritional information of the food.
3. Ads relating to various diet food items.


**Why are we different from the various fitness applications out there?**
1. All the applications are paid for premium users. This makes it difficult for the common
user to use it. We have made our business model different from all the apps out there. 
Millionare companies(Swiggy/Zomato) would definitely want to use this for showing their users 
what could they order according to their health demands. This has a very high probability of 
their sales rising..(the poeple who don't care about healths are still gonna continue to order
and those who do will get an incentive to try the heathy section that Swiggy/Zomato has)..

Diet food makers could post an Ad in our applications for all te health freaks out there!
2. Competition can make wonders happen! If staying healthy is difficult by the means of percentage, 
percentile it is.
We have added a feature where you could compare your health score with your friends/family members.
Craving for a cheese burst pizza? Look your best friend Amy had salad for lunch! :D
And maybe you could plan cheatdays with your gang together somedays later!! ;)


**Challenges we ran into**
1. Ooof, we thought searching for Dataset would be an easy thing. THERE IS NO DATASET ON ANY SITE WHICH COULD 
SHOW INDIAN COOKED FOOD AND ITS CALORIES. 
Scraping it via the internet, cleaning it was a task.
2.
