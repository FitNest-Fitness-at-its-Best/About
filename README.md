# FitNest - Fitness At Its Best
## About
Due to its drastic increase during the past decade, obesity is becoming an epidemic
phenomenon in most developed countries. 

The fact that more than thirty-three percent of 
adults and sixteen percent of children are obese has proven to be one of the
biggest public health challenges to the general population and social welfare. Unfortunately,
obesity has still not been controlled effectively.

Also, due to COVID-19, people have been mostly eating at their homes only, leading
to the illusion that theyâ€™re eating healthy. The amount of preservatives they have
been intaking missing from fast food is immense. Mindless eating while working from home can be a disaster to one's health.

This is why we propose a Food Detector - FitNest for the AngelHacks 2.0. 

Based on a photo taken by the user, the app detects the food present and respectively finds nutritional information for the given
food. The user can then log this data into a virtual diary which would help keep track of their calories consumed.

##Business Model:
1. Swiggy Idea-Swiggy/Zomato could use this as they can show through our app(if integrated) the nutritional information of the food.
2. Ads relating to various diet food items.
